    "Html": "<p>Hi,</p>\r\n<p>The easiest way to get started generating your own collections is to use the Excel&nbsp;Add-In. You can download it from here -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.silverlight.net/learn/data-networking/pivot-viewer/excel-tool\">http://www.silverlight.net/learn/data-networking/pivot-viewer/excel-tool</a>. That page also contains a pretty good explanation on how to use the Add-In.</p>\r\n<p>There is also a command line tool that gives you a little more flexibility -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.silverlight.net/learn/data-networking/pivot-viewer/command-line-tool\">http://www.silverlight.net/learn/data-networking/pivot-viewer/command-line-tool</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise if you want to write your own app to generate dynamic tiles then you can use the Deep Zoom tools -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.silverlight.net/archives/whitepapers/deep-zoom-tools\">http://www.silverlight.net/archives/whitepapers/deep-zoom-tools</a>. Generating the CXML is fairly straight forward, the schema is described here -&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.silverlight.net/learn/data-networking/pivot-viewer/collection-xml-schema\">http://www.silverlight.net/learn/data-networking/pivot-viewer/collection-xml-schema</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Hope that helps</p>\r\n<p>Roger</p>",
