    "Html": "<p>Hi Doug,</p>\r\n<p>The height is being set via JavaScript so that it is always the full height of the parent DIV - height is always tricky.</p>\r\n<p>If you override the&nbsp;.pv-filterpanel-accordion class in pivotviewer.css you can set the height to any value you'd like. For example, to set it to 200px:</p>\r\n<p>.pv-filterpanel-accordion { overflow-y:auto; overflow-x:hidden; margin-top:6px; <strong>height: 200px !important;</strong> }</p>\r\n<p>The key part is adding&nbsp;<strong>!important</strong> after the style.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let me know how you go</p>\r\n<p>Roger</p>",
