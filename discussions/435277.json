    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\nThe solution is to update the Draw method of the PivotViewer.Views.Tile object (in the TileController). You'll need to find the difference between the image size and the tile size and divide it by 2 to get the left padding in pixels. The same applies to the top padding.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis has been fixed in the commercial version, which you can contact LobsterPot Solutions to find out more.<br />\n",
