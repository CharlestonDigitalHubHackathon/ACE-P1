I've also seen this behavior on the PASS demo as well as some links people have posted in the discussions here.</p>\r\n<p>Is this a known issue with the control, or is this a problem with the image construction? Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>\r\n",

The tiles are created completely in the browser and so far has had improved performance over Deep Zoom collections. It's worth noting that collections that are heavily image based will still need to use Deep Zoom.</p>\r\n<p>Here is an example collection that uses dynamic tiles -&nbsp;pivot.lobsterpot.com.au/pass2012.htm. As you can see this also has basic Semantic Zoom&nbsp;functionality.</p>",
